# cpp-fundamentals
Basic C++ projects to practice conditions, loops, arrays, and functions.

## Projects in this Repository

### Conditions Projects
- **treasure_island.cpp** — A text-based Treasure Island game using nested if statements. The player makes a series of choices, and each wrong decision can lead to game over. This project practices C++ conditional logic clearly.

### Loops Projects

### Do-While

### Student Evaluation System 
- **File:** `loops/student_evaluation_do_while.cpp`
- **Description:** Reads grades for 10 students (0–100), validates input, counts passed and failed students.
- **Details:** Determines highest and lowest grade.
- **Learning Outcome:** Demonstrates do-while loops and conditional logic in C++.
