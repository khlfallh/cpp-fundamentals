# cpp-fundamentals
Basic C++ projects to practice conditions, loops, arrays, and functions.

## Projects in this Repository

### Conditions Projects
- **treasure_island.cpp** — A text-based Treasure Island game using nested if statements. The player makes a series of choices, and each wrong decision can lead to game over. This project practices C++ conditional logic clearly.

### Loops Projects

### Do-While

### Student Evaluation System 
- **File:** `loops/student_evaluation_do_while.cpp`
- **Description:** Reads grades for 10 students (0–100), validates input, counts passed and failed students.
- **Details:** Determines highest and lowest grade.
- **Learning Outcome:** Demonstrates do-while loops and conditional logic in C++.

### while 

#### Energy Monitoring System
- **File:** `loops/energy_monitoring.cpp`
- **Description:** Reads energy readings in kWh until 0 is entered.
- **Details:** Calculates total, average, max, min, and counts hours above average.
- **Learning Outcome:** Practicing loops, input validation, and simple calculations in C++.

### For

#### Daily Power Usage Analyzer
- **File:** `loops/daily_power_usage.cpp`
- **Description:** Reads 24 hourly power readings (Wh), calculates total, average, max, min, and tracks hour of maximum consumption.
- **Learning Outcome:** Practicing loops (`for` and `do-while`) and input validation in C++.
